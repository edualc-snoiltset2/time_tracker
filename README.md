## 🗃️ Database Schema

The application uses a local SQLite database managed by the **Drift** library. The schema is defined in `lib/database/database.dart` (current schema version: **3**) and consists of the following tables:

  * **Clients:** Stores client information, including name, address, email, and currency.
  * **Projects:** Manages projects, each linked to a client, with details like name, hourly rate, and time limits.
  * **TimeEntries:** Records individual time entries with descriptions, project associations, start/end times, and billable/billed/logged status flags.
  * **Expenses:** Keeps track of project-related expenses, including a description, amount, date, and associated project or client.
  * **Invoices:** Stores generated invoices with details like invoice ID, client, issue/due dates, total amount, and JSON-serialized line items.
  * **Todos:** A to-do list to manage tasks, with priorities, deadlines, and project links.
  * **CompanySettings:** A singleton table to store company-wide settings like name, address, logo, and invoice preferences.

Foreign key relationships use **cascade delete** rules — deleting a client cascades to its projects, which in turn cascades to associated time entries, expenses, and todos.
